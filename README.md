# MyCli

Welcome to my CLI! This is my first CLI project that allows a user to enter a street address to look up local election and candidate info in their area. I am using the Google Civic Information API to retrieve this information.

## Installation

clone the repo and `cd` into `my_cli` folder
run `bundle install` to install the gem dependencies


## Usage

1. Enter a valid street address
2. Select an election to get a list of the candidates
3. Choice of exit or return to main menu


## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
